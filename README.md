### Prerequisities

### Example applications
Example server applications which demonstrate the use of the passport strategy can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/energywebfoundation/iam-client-examples).
The repository also contains client examples which leverage the [iam-client-lib](https://github.com/energywebfoundation/iam-client-lib/) to interact with the server applications.
